# Quakemetaformer

Quakemetaformer is an extension built on top of [Metaformer](https://github.com/dqshuai/MetaFormer) that implements the transformer-based architecture for earthquake damage assessment. This repository contains the code and modifications implimented for the paper "Multiclass Post-Earthquake Building Assessment Integrating Optical and SAR Satellite Imagery, Ground Motion, and Soil Data with Transformers".

## Overview

Quakemetaformer integrates both satellite imagery and complementary metadata (e.g., ground motion, soil data, SAR-derived indices) into the framework to achieve improved performance in multiclass post-earthquake building damage assessment.

## Installation

For installation of the required libraries and dependencies, please refer to the main branch of the original Metaformer repository. You can find the installation instructions there, which include:

- Environment setup
- Dependency installation via `requirements.txt`
- Additional configuration details
