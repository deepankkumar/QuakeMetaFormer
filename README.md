# Quakemetaformer

Quakemetaformer is an extension built on top of [Metaformer](https://github.com/dqshuai/MetaFormer) that implements the novel transformer-based architecture for earthquake damage assessment. This repository contains the code for the paper "".

## Overview

Quakemetaformer integrates both satellite imagery and complementary metadata (e.g., ground motion, soil data, SAR-derived indices) into the transformer framework to achieve improved performance in multiclass post-earthquake building damage assessment. The design leverages the robust foundations of Metaformer while introducing modifications tailored for seismic damage analysis.
